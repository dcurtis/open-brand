This is The Open Brand, a framework for clearly and properly defining a brand. The Open Brand aims to help open source projects, companies, and people develop brand definitions that can be used properly, developed quickly, and referenced consistently.

Because of its structure, the Open Brand can be used by stakeholders possessing any level of design experience.

In addition to the following README, see inside the `png/`, `psd/`, `spec/`, and `svg/` folders for individual `README`s which define the structure of an Open Brand. 

For an example of an Open Brand in use, see [The Markdown Mark](http://github.com/dcurtis/markdown-mark).
